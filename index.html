                    <p>I've discovered a passion for creating the next software or the next apps of the future through front and backend development!</p>
                    <p>It all started on Khanacademy; I was learning how to animate using JavaScript processing and I was really fun. From there, I went on to learn HTML and CSS in the fall of my Junior Year of highschool. Then, I went into JavaScript and started to explore web development. After Codecademy let me get a free trial with python, I dove into the language and started to do what I could to learn and understand.</p>
                    <p>Here I am, a year and a half later, interning at JP Morgan Chase for the Upperline Code program for their FinTech Focus program, while being taught the skills I self-taught myself. I've learned so much in the first week with python and I'm excited to see where learning about responsive web design will take me.</p>
